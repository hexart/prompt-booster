## Making Changes

### Creating a Branch

Always create a new branch for your changes:

```bash
# Ensure you're on the main branch and it's up to date
git checkout main
git pull upstream main

# Create and switch to a new branch
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
```

Branch naming conventions:
- `feature/feature-name` - for new features
- `fix/bug-description` - for bug fixes
- `docs/documentation-update` - for documentation changes
- `refactor/component-name` - for code refactoring
- `test/test-description` - for adding or updating tests

### Making Your Changes

1. **Make your changes** in your feature branch
2. **Test your changes thoroughly**
   ```bash
   # Run tests
   pnpm test
   
   # Build to ensure no build errors
   pnpm build
   
   # Check code style
   pnpm lint
   ```

3. **Commit your changes**
   - Write clear, descriptive commit messages
   - Follow the conventional commit format:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "feat: add new prompt optimization algorithm"
   git commit -m "fix: resolve issue with template loading"
   git commit -m "docs: update API documentation"
   ```

### Commit Message Guidelines

We follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification:

- `feat:` - A new feature
- `fix:` - A bug fix
- `docs:` - Documentation only changes
- `style:` - Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code
- `refactor:` - A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- `test:` - Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
- `chore:` - Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools
