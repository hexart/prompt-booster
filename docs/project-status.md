# Prompt Optimizer - Project Status and Next Steps

## Current Progress Overview

We've made significant progress on our Prompt Optimizer rebuild project, focusing on establishing the foundation and beginning implementation of core components. Here's a summary of what we've accomplished so far:

### Completed Items

#### Architecture and Planning
- ✅ Established comprehensive architecture design for multi-platform application
- ✅ Created detailed development roadmap with phased implementation
- ✅ Defined technology stack and dependencies
- ✅ Designed monorepo structure for code sharing across platforms

#### Project Setup
- ✅ Set up monorepo structure with Turborepo
- ✅ Configured basic TypeScript configuration
- ✅ Set up initial file structure following architecture document
- ✅ Configured Tailwind CSS for styling

#### Web Application Foundation
- ✅ Created basic web application shell with navigation
- ✅ Implemented tab-based interface for different sections
- ✅ Set up Zustand stores for state management
- ✅ Implemented initial UI components:
  - ✅ PromptEditor component
  - ✅ TestResult component
  - ✅ PromptHistory component
  - ✅ ModelSettings component

#### API Integration
- ✅ Created API package structure
- ✅ Defined core API interfaces and types
- ✅ Started implementation of BaseApiClient
- ✅ Implemented CustomApiClient for flexible API connections
- ✅ Created ApiFactory for managing different provider implementations

### Current Challenges

1. **API Integration Completion**: Need to complete and test the API integration with various AI model providers
2. **UI Component Refinement**: Current UI components are functional but need additional features and refinement
3. **State Management**: Need to ensure proper error handling and state synchronization
4. **Testing**: Need to implement comprehensive testing for API calls and UI components

## Next Steps (Short-term)

Following our development roadmap, these are the immediate next steps:

### 1. Complete Core API Integration (Priority: High)
- Finish implementation of API clients for all supported models (OpenAI, Gemini, DeepSeek, Hunyuan)
- Add retry mechanisms and error handling
- Implement request/response caching
- Add thorough testing for API interactions

### 2. Enhance UI Components (Priority: High)
- Add additional features to PromptEditor (templates, formatting tools)
- Improve comparison view with diff highlighting
- Enhance settings panel with connection testing and validation
- Implement responsive design improvements

### 3. Implement Additional Core Features (Priority: Medium)
- Add multi-step optimization workflow
- Implement prompt templates system
- Create better history management with search and filtering
- Add export/import functionality for prompts

### 4. Backend Integration (Priority: Medium)
- Begin setting up Python FastAPI backend for authentication
- Implement database models for user data
- Create endpoints for synchronization
- Set up Docker configuration for deployment

## Looking Ahead (Medium-term)

After completing the immediate tasks, we'll move forward with:

### 1. Cross-Platform Development
- Begin Electron application implementation for desktop
- Start React Native development for mobile platforms
- Research WeChat Mini-Program implementation requirements

### 2. Data Synchronization
- Implement secure cross-platform synchronization
- Add offline capabilities
- Create conflict resolution strategies

### 3. Performance Optimization
- Optimize bundle size and loading performance
- Implement caching strategies for API responses
- Add performance monitoring

## Technical Notes for Continuation

When continuing development, keep these points in mind:

1. **Architecture Consistency**: Follow the established architecture pattern for all new components
2. **Code Sharing**: Maximize code reuse between platforms by abstracting platform-specific code
3. **API Handling**: Use the factory pattern for creating API clients
4. **State Management**: Use Zustand for global state, React Context for component-level state
5. **TypeScript**: Maintain strong typing throughout the project
6. **Testing**: Write tests for all new functionality

## Current Implementation Details

The current implementation follows a monorepo structure with these main packages:

1. **@prompt-booster/core**: Core business logic
2. **@prompt-booster/api**: API integration with different providers
3. **@prompt-booster/ui**: Shared UI components
4. **web application**: Main web interface

The web application uses:
- Zustand for state management
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- React for UI components
- TypeScript for type safety

The API package implements:
- A BaseApiClient abstract class
- Provider-specific implementations (CustomApiClient, etc.)
- A factory pattern for creating clients
- Standardized request/response interfaces

## Conclusion

We've made solid progress on establishing the foundation of the Prompt Optimizer project. The architecture is well-defined, and we've implemented the basic structure and core components. The next steps focus on completing API integration, enhancing UI components, and implementing additional features, followed by cross-platform development and data synchronization.

By following the established roadmap and architecture, we'll continue to build a robust, multi-platform application that provides users with powerful prompt optimization capabilities across web, mobile, desktop, and WeChat platforms.
